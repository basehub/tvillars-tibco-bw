While Business Works can ultimately make a huge increase in developer productivity, the learning curve for producing production quality services is very high.  Your typical 3GL Developer (C, C++, C#, Java, etc...) will not have experience with a 100% graphical development tool and can become frustrated with the coding and debugging life cycle that makes up a large portion of any software development effort.

To ease the learning curve and ensure a successful first experience, one approach is to leverage the work of experienced Business Works developers.  The TTB project is a tool for implementing this approach as it provides an open source framework and libraries for TIBCO's Business Works.
